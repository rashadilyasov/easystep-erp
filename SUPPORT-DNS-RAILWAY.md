**Subject:** Custom domain api.easysteperp.com — DNS records added, still "Waiting for DNS update"

---

**Message:**

Hello,

I'm trying to set up the custom domain `api.easysteperp.com` for my Railway service. I've added the DNS records in Bluehost exactly as shown in the Railway "Configure DNS Records" modal:

**CNAME Record:**
- Name: `api`
- Value: `2qz1te51.up.railway.app`

**TXT Record:**
- Name: `_railway-verify.api`
- Value: `railway-verify=14c0e4c118f0d2369b2607c434aafbc79742eb41ad3283b2ec3e6d6a91962237`

The records have been saved in Bluehost for over 24 hours, but Railway still shows "Waiting for DNS update" with a yellow warning. When I try to access https://api.easysteperp.com I get `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` in the browser.

Could you please:
1. Manually verify the DNS configuration on your side
2. Check if there's any issue with the domain or records
3. Advise if I need to add or change anything (e.g. different record format for Bluehost)

**Domain:** api.easysteperp.com  
**Railway service URL:** 2qz1te51.up.railway.app  
**DNS provider:** Bluehost

Thank you for your help.
