**Subject:** DNS Change Recommended — easysteperp.com — Need help updating records

---

**Message:**

Hello,

I am seeing "DNS Change Recommended" for my custom domains (easysteperp.com and www.easysteperp.com) in Vercel. The dashboard shows these records should be updated:

**Current (old) values I have in Bluehost:**
- A record: @ → 76.76.21.21
- CNAME record: www → cname.vercel-dns.com

**New values Vercel recommends (IP range expansion):**
- A record: @ → 216.198.79.1
- CNAME record: www → 7eb820fef6505c97.vercel-dns-017.com.

I have tried updating these records in Bluehost DNS / Zone Editor, but the yellow warning still does not go away. When I contacted support before, the issue was resolved quickly on your side.

Could you please:
1. Verify whether my DNS records are correctly propagated
2. Manually refresh or re-check the domain verification if possible
3. Confirm if there is anything else I need to change on my side (Bluehost)

**Project/domain:** easysteperp.com, www.easysteperp.com  
**DNS provider:** Bluehost

Thank you for your help.
